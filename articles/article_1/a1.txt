scale and instrumentation angle parameters (in each filter) were
fine-tuned and the matching repeated until the HST-to-infra-
red stellar positional match over nine frames of separation was
perfect. Checks of the infrared-based on HST guide star coor-
dinates for stars found between the two reference frames show
rms offsets under 0”5. We estimate that the final coordinates of
the infrared stars are accurate to 0°5 or better, chiefly limited
by the unknown astrometric quality (flatness and pixel
uniformity) of the PtSi arrays used.

Provisional stellar magnitudes and colors (see below) were
computed and examined for systematic effects. We found a
significant tendency for stars imaged onto the outer 10% of the
PtSi SQIID arrays to show unusual colors. This effect was
discovered in plots of mean stellar colors (J —H), (H — K), and
(J—K) versus raw array X and versus Y coordinates of the
stars. Two of these functions showed anomalous stellar colors
which were redder or bluer than stars imaged in the central
portions of the array. To remove this effect, stars imaged onto
the outer 10% of the array had their corresponding photo-
metry rejected. Coordinates were established for the remaining
stars in all the target frames, and all surviving data were
merged into one database for the target data and another for
the reference data. Duplicate stars, from neighboring target
frames (up to four), were identified and their magnitudes and
positions refined by a rule-based averaging process, which
accounted for imperfect sky coverage of the individual J, H,
and K SQIID arrays. Also, nonstellar entries (chiefly diffrac-
tions spikes) were identified and removed from the database.

Calibration sources were selected from the list of Elias et al.
(1982) and were observed on the same nights and through
similar air masses, as were observations of the target and refer-
ence images. Since the SQIID system is close to the Johnson
system (e.g., Lada, Young, & Green 1993) we elected to use the
SQIID camera filters and arrays as our standard system, and
to use in-band observations of the standards to establish the
filter zero points independently. Since the standard were
observed at about the same airmasses, infrared extinctions are
very small (0.1—0.2 magnitudes per airmass), and our reported
magnitudes and colors are likely not in error by much more
than their photometric uncertainties determined by APPHOT.

2.2. Millimeter-Wave, Molecular-Line Observations

We obtained observations of the 110 GHz J = 1-0 '3CO,
the 109 GHz J = 1-0 C'80, and the 98 GHz J = 2-1 CS
molecular emission lines toward the IC 5146 cloud complex
during the period between approximately 1991 January to
1991 April. These observations were made using the AT&T
Bell Laboratories 7m offset Cassegrain antenna, Located in
Holmdel, New Jersey. This instrument had a very clean Gauss-
ian beam with a FWHM of roughly 100’, which was indepen-
dent of frequency between 98 and 115 GHz. The primary beam
efficiency was about 87% and the aperture efficiency (which is
determined by the 14dB edge taper of the illumination pattern)
about 55%. The detector was a liquid-helium—cooled SIS
receiver built by NRAO with a single sideband temperature
Tssp ~ 75-130 K. The observations were made by both
in-band frequency-switching, in which the reference frequency
is displaced from the signal by 6.4 MHz, as well as the
multiple-mapping position-switching mode described by Bally
et al. (1987). We used a 250 kHz filterbank with 256 channels,
one-half of which were sent to a spectrum expander (Henry
1979) to give a resolution of 100 or 50 kHz (0.31 km s~* or 0.15
km s~‘! at 98 GHz). Integration times were adjusted so that the

DARK CLOUD IC 5146

rms noise temperature in the 50 kHz channels was 0.5 K for the
13CO observations and 0.2 K for C!8O and CS observations.
All data were calibrated with a blade chopper that permits
rapid comparison between the sky and a 77 K liquid-nitrogen—
cooled reference load or the 77 K load and an ambient tem-
perature absorber. The receiver noise temperature and the
temperature scale was determined by comparing a room tem-
perature load to the liquid-nitrogen load. Then the sky bright-
ness temperature was measured by comparison of the sky
emission with the cold load. A simple atmospheric model was
used to scale the observed intensities to the brightness tem-
perature that would have been measured by this antenna
above the atmosphere. The details of the receiver and cali-
bration procedure have been described elsewhere (Pound,
Bania, & Wilson 1990). All data were reduced using the
COMB spectral line reduction package. Frequency-switched
spectra were folded, and linear baselines were removed from
the spectra. Baselines were fitted to that portion of the spec-
trum which is devoid of emission. Spectra were examined, and
bad channels were eliminated.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Molecular-Line Observations

We first surveyed the complex in the ‘*CO line in a fast-
mapping mode to determine the extent of the molecular emis-
sion. Subsequent observations in the C'8O and CS emission
lines were confined to those regions where significant '*CO
emission was detected. These latter observations were obtained
with typically 2 to 3 times the integration time as the 1**CO
observations. Figure 1 shows the resulting maps of the inte-
grated emission from the '*CO and CS.

The map of integrated ‘*CO emission (Fig. 1a) delineates the
extent of the molecular emission from this dark cloud complex.
The distribution and extent of the '*CO emission agrees well
with that of the optical extinction observed on the POSS print
of this region, as well as with the lower resolution '*CO and
13CO maps of this cloud obtained by Dobashi et al. (1992).
Our '°CO map indicates that the complex consists of three
major subunits: the cluster, the Northern Streamer, and the
Southern Streamer. The cluster is located at the eastern end of
the complex, and itself consists of three bright emission cores
which were originally identified in the early '*CO observations
of Lada & Elmegreen (1979). This region was designated as
cloud E in the Dobashi et al. (1992) study and contains the
brightest '*CO and !2CO emission in the complex. The second
most prominent region is the Northern Streamer (cloud C in
the Dobashi et al. nomenclature) which is located about 1°
west and 0°3 north of the cluster region. The third most promi-
nent region is the Southern Streamer (cloud B in the Dobashi
et al. nomenclature) located about 0°3 south of the Southern
Streamer.

Figure 1b shows the integrated intensity CS map. The same
general features that are evident in this map as are also seen in
the '*CO map. However, in detail the two maps are strikingly
different. The strongest CS emission originates in the Northern
Streamer and not the cluster, clearly indicating that the 1*CO
to CS intensity ratio varies strongly within the cloud. Emission
from C!8O was mapped only around the cluster and in the
Northern Streamer region. In these regions the distribution of
C!8O emission is comparable to CS; in particular, like CS, the
C!8O emission peaks in the Northern Streamer region rather
than toward the cluster.

of the molecule through the cloud. Consequently, it would
appear that there is an inherent uncertainty (of roughly a factor
of 5) in using '*CO observations to derive a hydrogen column
densities along a given line of sight within a molecular cloud.

Direct comparison of C!8O and CS emission throughout the
cloud suggests that the larger-than-expected scatter in Figures
14 and 15 is also due to intrinsic variations in the excitation or
abundances of the two molecules. The emission from the two
species is found to be linearly correlated with a scatter which is
independent of the strength of the emission and whose disper-
sion (i.€., O,esiduais) 1S a factor of 2 greater than the mean uncer-
tainties in the integrated intensities of each line. Evidently,
C’8O observations can be more reliably used to determine
hydrogen column densities and molecular cloud mass than
13CO observations, however, inherent uncertainties on the
order of a factor of 2 are still present even for this tracer.

Finally, we note that in all three cases the fits have intercepts
that are positive. This results in the uncomfortable prediction
of molecular emission at an extinction of zero magnitudes. This
could be produced by a zero-point error in either the extinc-
tion or molecular-line measurements or by some measurement
bias at low extinctions and/or integrated intensities. We have
not identified any such effects in our data, and at the present
time we have no explanation for this property of the fits. We
did investigate the possibility of a mismatch between our
square measurement box and the Gaussian radio telescope
beam, which is sensitive to emission, located outside its half-
power beamwidth and beyond the area of the measurement
box. To investigate this possibility we doubled the area of the
measurement box and redetermined the extinctions at each
point in the ‘°CO grid. This larger box had diameter of 2’4.
Fitting the integrated intensity versus extinction data over
similar ranges in extinction, we found that the intercepts of the
fits typically decreased in value but still remained positive
when the larger box size was used.

5.4. Molecular Abundances

The ultimate goal of comparison of molecular-line emission
with extinction measurements is to determine directly the
abundance of each molecule relative to hydrogen. Until now,
such determinations have been made at relatively low extinc-
tions (0O—4 mag; e.g., Dickman 1978; Minn & Greenberg 1979;
Sandell et al. 1981; Bachiller & Cernicharo 1984; Mattila
1986; Duvert, Cernicharo, & Baudry 1968; Langer et al. 1989,
etc.) Our extinction map of IC 5146 offers the possibility of
making such determinations not only in more opaque regions
of a molecular cloud, but also, for the first time, for molecules,
such as CS, which require high densities for excitation.

In principle, we can convert our integrated intensities to
molecular column densities at each point in the map, compare
these to the (H — K) derived extinctions and thereby directly
measure the abundance of each molecule at over 500 locations
in the cloud. However, with the current single-transition
molecular-line data set we are limited to determining LTE
column densities for each of the observed molecules. We expect
that non-LTE effects may be operating in the cloud, and LTE
column density estimates are likely to be somewhat inaccurate.
Nonetheless, the LTE column densities for each molecule were
calculated at each point in the cloud, assuming that the excita-
tion temperature of ‘*CO and C'8O is the same as that of

~ !2CO, which has been measured by Dobashi et al. (1993) to be

about 10 K, and, in addition, found to be constant throughout
the cloud to a good approximation. For the CS emission, we

assumed that the levels were subthermally excited and that the
excitation temperature was only 5 K. We also calculated the
LTE column densities of CS assuming an excitation tem-
perature of 10 K, and the results were not significantly different
from the LTE calculations based on a 5 K temperature.

We obtained the ratio of LTE molecular column density to
Ay at each point in the cloud for each molecule. The results are
displayed in Figures 16, 17, and 18, where we plot this ratio
versus extinction for 1*CO, C!8O, and CS, respectively. For
each molecule we obtained the mean abundance ratio over the
range for which the integrated intensities were found to be
linearly correlated with extinction:

tal line. We also determined, in a similar manner, the

this experiment, we obtained data in the J, H, and K bands.
The optics were configured to provide a field of view of
approximately 5'9 x 5'9 and a resolution of 1°39 per pixel at J
band. At K band the resolution was 1°36 per pixel. SQUD
JHK images were obtained in three regions of the cloud
complex. Twenty-four images were obtained at each wave-
length band in a roughly 5 x 5 mosaic grid centered on the
optical cluster, IC 5146. An additional 24 SQUID fields were
observed in a 3 x 8 mosaic grid toward a portion of the dark
cloud well removed from the cluster. Finally, four SQUID fields
were observed at each band in a control region off the cluster
and molecular cloud in an area apparently devoid of extinction
and molecular emission. In this paper we will discuss the
results obtained for the dark cloud region, which we designate
as the Northern Streamer, and the four control fields. Observa-
tions of the cluster region will be presented elsewhere (Lada et
al. 1994).

The fields observed in the direction of the Northern
Streamer were spatially overlapped by ~0‘9 in both mght
ascension and declination, allowing for both the accurate posi-
tional placement of the mosaicked fields and redundancy of
our photometric measurements of sources located in the over-
lapped regions. The control field images were not overlapped.
The integration time in each filter, for observations both on
and off IC 5146, was 3 minutes. Each on field was observed
twice, with a 15” offset or dither between observations. A com-
bination of the standard Image Reduction and Analysis
Facility (IRAF) routines’ and custom software were used for
data reduction. The data were reduced by subtracting a dark
frame from each image, dividing by a flat field, and then sub-
tracting the value of the local sky. To construct flat fields, the
median sky level for each subtracted image was determined
and used to normalize each frame. Eight different flat fields for
each filter were constructed by median filtering (to remove
stars and extended emission) the 13 time-neighboring normal-
ized images. These 24 (8 frames times 3 filters) flat-field images
were also autonormalized before division into the appropriate
dark-corrected (but not normalized) images.

Comparisons to the conventional sky removal method
(direct, frame-by-frame sky subtraction) were performed to
verify the quality of the images produced by our noncon-
ventional method. Analysis of photometric values returned by
both methods found virtually identical results for identified
stars. However, our median-median method produced images
with lower rms sky noise and a lack of the common negative-
going defects produced by incomplete removal of extended
stellar point-spread functions (PSFs) in the conventional
method sky (reference) images. Because the sky brightness
levels were significantly variable during the observing for this
project, the initial normalization before median filtering
enabled more complete removal of the stellar PSFs in the com-
puted flat-field frames than occurred using the conventional
approach.

Stellar profiles were examined for each image and showed
full width at half-maximum (FWHM) intensities between 175
and 2"1, with a mean of 179 and a dispersion of 0°1. The
routine DAOFIND was used to extract sources with a finding
threshold set to 5 times the rms sky noise in each frame. Photo-
metry was obtained for all extracted stars in the final images

using APPHOT for a number of different aperture sizes.
Photometric measurements were independently obtained for
each dithered pair of images toward each field. Custom stellar
matching software was used to compare the magnitudes
obtained for each dithered stellar pair. Plots of the difference
magnitudes for each star versus the mean magnitude showed
no systematic offset, while still displaying the flared errors at
faint magnitudes expected. Further, plots of the difference mag-
nitude versus the internal photometric uncertainties, returned
by APPHOT, showed no unexpected effects or features. We
conclude that the internal APPHOT uncertainties are reason-
ably good estimators of the true photometric uncertainties.

Histograms of the apparent magnitude distributions of stars
which were identified and matched across the dithered pairs of
frames were plotted along with histograms of the magnitudes
for stars which were found in only one or the other frame. The
latter showed a peak at faint magnitudes exactly coinciding
with the faint edge (the faint magnitude half-power point) of
the peak of the matched star distribution. The conclusion
drawn was that both distributions are returning information
concerning the completeness limit, in the form of the numbers
of stars detected and missed as a function of apparent magni-
tude. Using these distributions together and moving to bright-
er magnitudes, where the fraction of missed stars falls to 10%
or less, we estimate that our imaging and stellar photometric
extractions are 90% complete in the individual dithered image
pairs to m, = 14.6, my, = 14.1, and m, = 13.1. In order to
extend the completeness another 0.75 mag fainter, each pair of
dithered images was registered and added, and stars were
refound and photometered, yielding totals of 5793, 5732, and
3184 stars in the J, H, and K bands, respectively, for the 24
target and four reference fields.

The average number of stars found per frame was about 200
at J, reducing the need for PSF fitting photometric extractions.
However, some stars were closely placed, requiring stopping
down the synthetic stellar apertures to avoid contamination
for these stars. In order to determine the run of stellar flux with
aperture size, moderately bright, but well-isolated stars on
each frame, and in each filter, were measured for all stellar
apertures (from 273 to 370 radius) and for two very large aper-
tures (up to 575 radius). All stellar magnitudes were thus scaled
up to a uniform, large effective aperture.

Coordinates (epoch 2000) for stars found in the Northern
Streamer (but not the reference fields) were established based
on a combination of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) guide
stars and stellar matches from neighboring infrared images.
Two of the infrared fields, located on opposite right assession
ends of the 8(a«) x 3(6) mosaic, had three or more HST guide
stars contained in them. Matching of these optical stars to their
infrared counterparts established rough plate scales and instru-
ment rotation angles, relative to the equatorial system. Frame
center coordinates were determined and used to generate equa-
torial coordinates for infrared stars near the image boundaries
which had corresponding matching infrared stars in neighbor-
ing frames. This coordinte passing technique was repeated
from the initial mosaic frame (containing 5 HST guide stars)
through nine neighboring frames to the check frame
(containing three HST guide stars). In this fashion, the effective
pixel resolution for coordinate determination is increased from
about 100-200 (the largest pixel separation between HST stars
on a single infrared image) to about 1500-1800 (separation
across eight frames). Careful attention to proper projections
(gnomic) and deprojections were included in the process. Plate

1026 boxes in the grid. Only three squares contained no stars.

Figure 3 shows the resulting contour map of the J-band star
counts in the Northern Streamer. The contour map has been
coded so that the regions of lowest surface density are more
prominent. The solid contours trace out the regions of highest
dust extinction in the cloud. We can convert the star counts to
an extinction with knowledge of both the luminosity function
and surface density of stars in the control field via

where Nor is the surface density of stars in the control field,
N,,n 18 the corresponding surface density of stars (at any point)
in the cloud, b, is the slope of the cumlative J luminosity
function of the stars in the control field, and the ratio A,/A, is
the reddening law between V and J wavelengths. For our
control field, we find that Nop = 20 in a square box 1'5 on a
side, and b, = 0.36 mag. The outermost solid contour rep-
resents a level of 10 counts and corresponds to a visual extinc-
tion of 3 mag. Within this contour level structure is clearly
evident. Figure 4 shows a contour map of integrated CS emis-
sion presented at the same scale as the star count map. The CS
emission traces dense (ny, => 10* cm~*) molecular gas in the
cloud. There is a good degree of similarity between the two
maps, confirming our proposition that the infrared star counts
are a good tracer of the dust distribution in the dense, inner
portions of this dark cloud. Furthermore, the close similarity
between the two maps suggests that a significant fraction of the
stars observed are background field stars unrelated to the
cloud.

Our observations represent a substantial improvement over
previous star counting studies of molecular clouds, which were
done exclusively at visual wavelengths (e.g., Dickman 1978;
Cernicharo & Bachiller 1984). For example, consider the star
counting study of the Taurus and Perseus molecular clouds by
Cernicharo & Bachiller (1984), one of the most sensitive and
extensive optical star counting studies ever done for a molecu-
lar cloud. In this study, a visual extinction of only 4.5 mag was
typically sufficient to render a reseau square of 2'5 x 2!5 in size
void of stars! For Ay ~ 3.5 mag, only 1—2 optical stars were
counted in such a 2'5 x 2'5 square. However, we find that it
requires visual extinctions in excess of roughly 17 mag to
reduce our J-band counts to only 1—2 sources in a square of
similar size. Thus, the dynamic range in visual magnitudes of
extinction is at least a factor of nearly 5 greater than that of the
Taurus-Perseus experiment. Consequently, our J-band star
counts trace the distribution of dust to higher column densities
with higher spatial resolution than has previously been pos-
sible in any molecular cloud.

3.2.2. Stellar Colors

The JHK infrared color-color diagram is a powerful tool for
investigating the nature of stellar objects (Lada & Adams
1992). In Figures Sa and 5b, we show the JHK color-color
diagrams for the control fields (Fig. 5a) and the Northern
Streamer (Fig. 5b). These plots display only those stars in each
region for which photometric uncertainties in each color were
less than 0.10 mag. Also plotted in the figures are the locus of
points. corresponding to the unreddened main sequence and
the locus of points corresponding to the positions of giant
stars. Two parallel dashed lines form the reddening zone for
main sequence stars. The bulk of the stars in the control field
have colors of G-K stars. Many of these are presumably giant
stars. Only a handful of stars fall in the infrared excess region
to the right of the reddening zone. The two stars with the
largest infrared excess were found to be doubles, with one
component visible only in the K band. Of the roughly 900
JHK stars observed with high-quality photometry toward the
Northern Streamer, only a dozen or so show colors suggestive
of significant infrared excess (none of these were obvious
doubles). The vast majority of stars show normal stellar colors
with various amounts of reddening. Comparison of the two
diagrams strongly suggests that the vast majority of stars
observed toward IC 5146 are field stars and unrelated to the
cloud. Moreover, a significant number of these stars are clearly
reddened background objects observed through the cloud.

4. ANALYSIS: THE COLOR EXCESS METHOD FOR
EXTINCTION DETERMINATION

It has been recognized for some time that infrared colors
could be used to directly measure the extinction and its dis-
tribution through a molecular cloud (e.g., Hyland 1980; Jones |
et al. 1981; Frerking et al. 1982). The line-of-sight extinction to
an individual star can be directly determined from knowledge
of its color excess and the extinction law. The color excess,
FE(H — K), can be directly derived from observations, provided
the intrinsic color of the star is known:

E(H — K) = (H — K) observea ~ (H — K ) intrinsic (1)

The intrinsic (HW — K) colors of normal main sequence and
giant stars have a relatively small range: between 0.0 to 0.3
magnitudes for stars with spectral types between AO and late
M (e.g., Koornneef 1983). With the simple assumption that the

N('?CO)/A, ratio using extinctions derived with a 2/4 size
measuring box and found the ratio to be within 10% of the
value quoted above for the 1/7 boxes. We note that for ‘°CO,
the calculated abundance ratio falls about a factor of 6 below
the mean value at the highest extinctions, illustrating once
more the effects of high optical depths on the '3CO emission.
Clearly, '3CO is not a good tracer of gas column density at
extinctions much greater than about 10 mag. On the other
hand, the derived LTE abundances of C!8O and CS at the
highest extinctions are within only a factor of 2 of the esti-
mated mean value, and this is less than the overall scatter in
the calculated ratios.

It is instructive to investigate the relative abundance of
13CO and C'8O as a function of cloud depth. In Fig. 19 we
plot the mean ratio of the **CO and C*8O column densities as
a function of A,. This ratio has been computed by binning the
individually calculated ratios into intervals of A, 3 mag in
width and taking the mean value of the ratio 1n each extinction
bin. The upper curve shows the ratio of the column densities;
the lower plot shows the calculated dispersion in this ratio. In
the outer parts of the cloud (ie., Ay < 10 mag) the '°CO to
C!8O column density ratio is large, considerably greater than
the terrestrial ratio of 5.5. Such large ratios were also found at
low extinctions in the studies of Bachiller & Cernicharo (1986)

fractionation of ‘CO and selective photodissociation of C18O
(e.g., van Dishoeck & Black 1988). For A, greater than 10 mag,
the column density ratio is essentially terrestrial. However, it is
somewhat difficult to interpret the significance of this, given
that the '*CO emission is optically thick in these regions of the
cloud. (We note that over the same Ay, intervals, the mean
integrated intensity ratio of the two species varies in a very
similar manner from values of roughly 14 to 4). However, what
is striking about Fig. 14 is that the dispersion in the ratio of the
column densities is a also a strong function of extinction. In the
outer parts of the cloud, the dispersion is very large, while
beyond 10 mag depth it is small. This strongly suggests that the
abundances of one or both of the species of CO are unstable in
the outer parts (i.e., A, < 10 mag) of the cloud, probably due to
active chemical processing by UV radiation. For visual extinc-
tions greater than 10 mag, the C’8O and 1°CO abundances
appear quite stable.

5.5. Comparison With Previous Studies

It would be useful to compare the abundances derived in this
study to abundances derived using traditional optical star
count methods. Unfortunately, such abundance studies do not
exist for this cloud. However, !*CO abundances derived from
star count studies have been reported for a number of other
molecular clouds. These LTE abundances compare well to
those derived here for IC 5146 (e.g., Irvine, Goldsmith, & Hyjal-
marson 1987; Bachiller & Cernicharo 1986). In particular, the
mean !3CO abundance derived by Dickman (1978) for a heter-
ogeneous sample of molecular clouds using star counts is
essentially the same as our '*CO abundance determination for
the Northern Streamer of IC 5146. Our abundance also
appears to be similar to those derived from star count studies
of the Perseus dark clouds (Bachiller & Cernicharo 1986), the
Ophiuchi dark clouds (Dickman & Herbst 1990), the L1495
dark cloud (Duvert et al. 1986), and BS (Langer et al. 1989).
Similarly, our C!®O abundances compare well to those derived
from star counts for L 1495 (Duvert et al. 1986) and BS (Langer
et al. 1989). However, it is not clear how much weight should
be attached to the apparent similarity in derived abundances
between our study and previous work. Except for Dickman
(1978), the abundances quoted in star count studies are derived
from the slopes of linear fits to column density versus extinc-
tion plots, whereas in this study and in Dickman (1978), the
abundance is derived from direct averaging of the individual
determinations. In principle, both determinations should give
the same result. However, we found that although our linear
fits to the various column density versus extinction relations
indicated that the quantities were correlated to a very high
probability, the fits were also characterized by relatively low
correlation coefficients (0.5—0.7). This suggested that using the
slopes of the relations to derive abundances could introduce
relatively large (a factor of 2) uncertainties. Consequently, we
adopted the abundances derived from averaging the individual
determinations through the cloud. These abundance determi-
nations were typically a factor of 1.5—2 times greater than those
we derived from the slopes of linear fits to the column density

versus A, relations for each molecule.

It is perhaps most interesting to compare our results to those
of Frerking et al. (1982), who derived **CO and C'8O abun-
dances in the Taurus and Ophiuchi clouds also using infrared

average (H—K) color of a typical field star is 0.15 mag, the
maximum resulting uncertainty introduced to a determintion
of the total line-of-sight visual extinction (A,) would be only
about 2.5 visual magnitudes. Clearly, more accurate color
excess determinations are possible if the intrinsic colors of stars
background to a target cloud are known. Observations of
nearby control fields can be used very effectively to determine
the intrinsic colors of background stars, provided that the
control field stars do not themselves suffer significant random
extinction.

Inspection of Figure 5a shows that the observed colors of the
control field stars near IC 5146 are well constrained to normal,
mostly main-sequence values. There is no evidence of any sig-
nificant amounts of reddening in this color-color diagram.
Therefore, with the assumption that all the stars observed
toward the IC 5146 dark cloud are background field stars
identical in nature to those in the control fields, we can use the
mean (H—K) color of the control field stars to approximate
the intrinsic (H — K) color of all stars background to the cloud:

(H — K )intrinsic = ((H — K)> controt = 0.13 + 0.01 mag . (2)

This mean H — K color is equivalent to that of an early K star
(Koornneef 1983; Bessel & Bret 1988). Using equations (1) and
(2) we determined the color excess for 1295 stars with H- and
K-band photometric uncertainties less than 0.15 mag observed
in the direction of the Northern Streamer. Of these, all but
about 30 stars were detected in all three infrared bands. Color
excesses were determined for only those JHK stars which
showed normal colors (1.e., stars with infrared excess were not
included in the sample). Our database of color excesses and
source positions represents a map of the distribution of color
excess (and extinction) through the cloud which is obtained
with very high spatial resolution (ie., 1’—2”). However, this
map is heavily undersampled, and the measurement points
(stars) are distributed across it in a spatially nonuniform
fashion. However, these data can be used to construct a

uniform and well-sampled map of the distribution of extinction
through the cloud by effectively smoothing the angular
resolution of the infrared observations to size scales compara-
ble to the star count and millimeter-wave observations. To do
this we binned the data in a manner analogous to star
counting. That is, we scanned the map with a square spatial
filter 15 x 1/5 in size and sampled at the Nyquist (Spatial)
frequency. Thus, we obtained the mean color excess of all the
stars in the square, viz.,

<E(H — K)> = 2é=1 HE) (3)

The result is a fully sampled, high-resolution map of the
infrared color excess through the cloud. Since the infrared
color excess is proportional to dust column density, this is
equivalent to a map of dust column density through the cloud.
Following convention, we find it convenient to represent the
dust column density in terms of A,, the extinction in the visual
wavelength band, rather than color excess. The extinction at
any wavelength is directly related to the color excess by a
simple scale factor, which is given by the reddening law. Conse-
quently, we converted the mean color excess at each point to
an equivalent visual mean extinction using the normal
reddening law (Rieke & Lebosfky 1985):

<Ay> = 15.9(E(H —K)) . (4)

The resulting extinction map is displayed in Figure 6 and apart
from the scale factor of 15.9 is identical to a map of color
excess. The derived extinction ranges from about 1 magnitude
to 40 magnitudes and corresponds to a variation in dust
column density of about a factor of 40 from the low extinction
outer regions of the cloud to the most opaque cores. The
overall shape and structure in the map is very similar to both
the J-band star count map and the CS map. By spatially inte-
grating the extinction map, we can determine a very accurate

color-excesses of background stars. Their methodology was
very similar to ours, except that they measured the colors of
only a single star at the position of each CO observation.
Moreover, they were only able to determine extinctions toward
roughly a dozen stars of known spectral type in each of the
clouds and were not able to map the distributions of extinc-
tions. However, they were able to determine the abundance of
13CO in Taurus along lines of sight showing A,’s of about 20
mag. Although they measured the abundances toward only
about a dozen stars, their plot of N(‘*CO) versus A, for the
Taurus clouds reveals all the same important qualitative fea-
tures as we find for IC 5146 from Figure 8 of this paper (1.e., a
more or less linear correlation of '*CO column density, with
Ay up to about 5 mag with clear evidence for effects of satura-
tion at higher extinctions). However, the overall ‘°CO abun-
dance they derive appears to be about a factor of 2 lower than
that we have derived for IC 5146. On the other hand, for
Ophiuchus, where their measurements extended out to an A,
of only about 10 mag, they derive a similar ‘*CO abundance as
derived here but find that the ‘*CO column density appears to
be linearly correlated with extinction out to 10 mag, a result
similar to that reported by Dickman & Herbst (1990). Our
data could also be fitted by a linear function out to 8-10 mag,
but the resulting slope is significantly flatter than that derived
for the 0-5 mag range, and this suggests that caution needs to
be applied when extending such relations beyond 5—6 magni-
tudes of visual extinction. The abundances Frerking et al.
(1982) derived for C‘8O in Taurus and Ophiuchus are quite
similar to those derived here for IC 5146.

Our CS abundance determination is the first direct CS abun-
dance determination to be made for a dense molecular cloud.
Prior determinations of CS abundances in dark clouds have
been accomplished by comparing the derived CS column
density with an estimate of the molecular hydrogen density,
which is indirectly derived either from excitation calculations
or by a direct comparison with the observed column density of
another molecule, such as C1®O, whose abundance relative to
H, is assumed to be known (e.g., Swade 1989). To date, almost
all such determinations have been made in warm (T, ~ 20-50
K), massive, and dense cores such as Orion and M17, which
have significant star-formation activity within them. The
derived CS abundances in these regions is about an order of
magnitude larger than derived here for the Northern Streamer
(e.g., Irvine et al. 1987 and references therein), although there
are large variations in these measurements. On the other hand,
our derived CS abundance is comparable to that(~5 x 107 *°)
recently derived for the dark cloud L134N by Swade & Sch-
loerb (1992) from observations and analysis of the CS
J =2-—-1andJ = 3 > 2 transitions.

6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have developed a method which uses observations of the
infrared color excesses of background stars to directly measure
and map the distribution of dust extinction through a molecu-
lar cloud. Because infrared excess is directly proportional to
extinction, this method provides a more direct and accurate
measure of extinction than does star counts. Moreover,
because the infrared color excess is also proportional to dust
column density, the derived extinction map reflects the actual
distribution of dust through a cloud. We have applied this
technique to determine the distribution of extinction in a dark
cloud near the cluster IC 5146. The results are compared to

13CO, C180, and CS molecular-line observations obtained at
the same angular resolution. The primary results derived from
our study can be summarized as follows.

1. We have constructed a detailed map of the distribution of
extinction for the Northern Streamer cloud of the IC 5146
cloud complex at an effective spatial resolution of 1'5. We have
integrated this map to determine the total mass of the cloud
and find a value of 2800(D/1 kpc)? with a statistical uncertainty
of +28 (D/1 kpc)? Mo for those regions where Ay, is greater
than 4 mag.

2. We find that the dispersion in our extinction measure-
ments varies with derived mean extinction in an interesting
and well-determined manner. In particular, the dispersion or
error associated with an extinction determination appears to
linearly increase with the derived mean extinction. In addition,
the dispersion in the dispersion also increases with extinction.
From analysis of the errors, modeling of the spatial distribu-
tion of extinction on small scales, and modeling the contribu-
tion of foreground stars, we find that variations in cloud
structure on scales smaller than the resolution of our measure-
ments dominate the observed errors at moderate and high
extinctions in this cloud.

3. From our models, we demonstrate that the form of the
observed 64;,, versus Ay relation can be used to place con-
straints on the nature of the spatial distribution of extinction
on scales smaller than our resolution. In particular, we show
that models in which the dust is distributed uniformly or in
discrete high extinction clumps on scales smaller than 15 are
inconsistent with the observations.

4. We have derived extinctions at the same locations and at
the same angular resolution (1/7) as the '°CO, C1O, and CS
observations we have obtained for this cloud. From compari-
son of the data we have determined the integrated intensity to
A, ratios for ‘*CO, C*8O, and CS at higher angular resolution
and to significantly deeper cloud depths (~30 visual
magnitudes) than any previous study.

5. The integrated intensities of ‘*CO, C'8O, and CS are
found to be correlated with extinction. However, while the
C!8O and CS emission appears to vary in a roughly linear
manner over the entire range of measured extinction (i.e., 0-30
mag), the variation of '*CO emission with A, is decidedly
nonlinear. Our data clearly show that the ‘*CO emission satu-
rates at cloud depths between 5—8 mag of visual extinction.
This result has already been suggested in previous work per-
formed at lower extinction ranges (e.g., Dickman 1978; Langer
et al. 1989; Freking et al. 1982; Bachiller & Chernicaro 1986;
Dickman & Herbst 1990).

6. There is a large scatter in all three correlations. The bulk
of this scatter appears to be intrinsic and indicates that the
abundances and/or excitation conditions for the molecules
vary significantly from point to point in the cloud. This sug-
gests that there is an intrinsic uncertainty (of a factor of 2—5 in
magnitude) associated with determining cloud hydrogen abun-
dances or masses from molecular-line observations.

7. The ratio of the of ‘*CO to C*8O LTE column densities
varies with extinction. At extinctions below 10 mag, the ratio is
significantly larger than the terrestrial value of 5.5, while it is
very close to this value at larger cloud optical depths. More
significantly, the dispersion in this column density ratio also
varies with extinction and is very large for extinctions less than
10 mag. This suggests that the abundances of '3CO and C'8O
are unstable down to cloud depths as deep as 10 mag. At the

the constancy of the gas-to-dust ratio in interstellar clouds,
which has been observationally well established (e.g., Lilley
1955; Jenkins & Savage 1974; Bohlin, Savage, & Drake 1978).
In principle, the overall distribution of dust in a cloud can be
directly traced by measurements of the extinction of back-
ground starlight produced at visual and near-infrared wave-
lengths by the cloud. Historically, such measurements have
been severely limited by the lack of sufficient numbers of back-
ground stars, which could be observed through the cloud.
However, as we will demonstrate in this paper, the advent of
sensitive near-infrared array cameras has dramatically altered
this situation.

Traditionally, the general method to derive the extinction in
a dark molecular cloud has been throughout use of star counts
(Bok & Cordwell 1973). In this method a rectilinear grid is
overlaid on a photographic image of a cloud, and the number
of stars in each box or reseau square in the grid is counted.
These counts are compared to counts in a nearby, unobscured,
comparison field. With knowledge of the (apparent) luminosity
function of field stars in the general direction of the cloud, the
ratio of counts ON and oFF the cloud can be converted directly
into an extinction. This technique suffers from a number of
limitations (Rossano 1980), the principal one being the uncer-
tainty introduced by Poisson statistics. This uncertainty is
given by ,/n, where n is the number of stars counted in a reseau
square (Bok 1937).

The most extensive star counting studies of molecular clouds
have involved counts of stars on optical prints of the Palomar
Observatory Sky Survey (e.g., Dickman 1978; Rossano 1978;
Cernicharo & Bachiller 1984; Mattila 1986). Unfortunately,
the dynamic range of such optical star counts is limited. For
example, on an unobscured region of a POSS print in the
Perseus region, there are typically 10* stars per square degree
(Cernicharo & Bachiller 1984). However, on size scales of 2’—3’,
comparable to those characteristic radio molecular-line obser-
vations, only about 25-35 stars are counted in regions with no
extinction. Consequently, only 3.5—4 mag of visual extinction
are sufficient to reduce the number of stars within a single
reseau square to unity. Moreover, systematic uncertainties can
dominate statistical uncertainties in such studies (Rossano
1980), rendering extinction estimates above about 3 visual mag
highly uncertain. It would clearly be important to be able to
determine extinctions in more opaque and denser regions of
molecular clouds, where star formation occurs and molecules
other than '*CO and !3CO are found.

Since extinction decreases with wavelength, observations
made at longer wavelengths can detect more background stars
through a cloud and probe deeper cloud depths (e.g., Dickman
& Herbst 1990; Straw & Hyland 1989). For example, a star
suffering 10 mag of visual extinction will be extincted by 2.8
mag at J (1.25 wm) and only 1.1 mag at K (2.2 wm). With the
development of large-format infrared imaging detectors, it is
now possible to obtain infrared star counts which are capable
of measuring dust column densities over relatively larger
regions of the sky with a dynamic range 5S—10 times larger than
previous optical studies. More significantly, however, multi-
channel array cameras make possible simultaneous, multicolor
infrared surveys of molecular clouds. It has been long appre-
ciated that infrared color excess can be used to directly deter-
mine extinction to individual stars behind molecular clouds
(e.g., Jones, Hyland, & Bailey 1981; Frerking, Langer, &
Wilson 1982). However, with single-channel infrared detectors,
only small numbers of background stars could be practically

observed at more than one wavelength through any given
molecular cloud. Consequently, such observations could not
compete with star count studies for determining the distribu-
tion of extinction through a cloud or for comparison with
molecular-line observations. Infrared array cameras largely
remove this limitation by making it possible to simulta-
neously determine the colors of hundreds to thousands of
background sources through a molecular cloud. This enables
the implementation of a new and more direct technique for
measuring and mapping extinction than star counting. This
method, which we introduce and describe in this paper, uses
measurements of infrared color excess together with certain
aspects of star counting to directly derive and map the extinc-
tion through a cloud. Because infrared color excess is pro-
portional to dust column density, the extinction maps
produced by this method also accurately trace the distribution
of dust through a cloud.

In this contribution, we report the initial results of the appli-
cation of this method of extinction determination to the molec-
ular cloud complex near IC 5146. IC 5146 is a young cluster in
Cygnus. On optical photographs it appears associated with a
large complex of dark clouds which extends more than 2° to its
west. Overall, the cloud has a filamentary appearance and is
morphologically similar to the famous p Ophiuchi cloud
complex. Recently, Dobashi et al. (1992) obtained a large-scale
“CO survey of the complex which traced its complete extent.
Dobashi et al. (1992) derived a mass of approximately 4500
Mo for this entire complex, which is slightly more massive
than the well-known Taurus cloud complex.

We have performed an extensive and coordinated near-
infrared imaging/molecular-line survey of a large portion of
this dark cloud. From our infrared observations we obtained
(H — K) infrared colors of more than 1000 stars and used them
to directly measure and map the extinction through the cloud
at the same and higher angular resolutions as our molecular-
line observations. This enabled both a very accurate determi-
nation of the cloud mass as well as direct measurements of the
LTE abundances of '*CO, C80, and CS between 0-30 mag of
visual extinction, a range of extinction roughly 25 mag greater
than that investigated in previous optical star count studies.

In § 2 we describe our data collection and reduction
methods. Section 3 reports the basic results of these observa-
tions. In § 4 we describe our method for measuring infrared
extinction and determining the distribution of extinction
through the cloud. In § 5 we compare the extinction measure-
ments with molecular line observations, evaluate and discuss
the limitations and uncertainties in the method, and discuss the
implications of our observations for understanding the struc-
ture of the molecular cloud. Section 6 presents a concise
summary of our major results.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION METHODS

2.1. Infrared Array Camera Observations

The near-infrared imaging data were obtained using the
National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) Simulta-
neous Quad Infrared Imaging Device (SQIID) on the Kitt
Peak National Observatory (KPNO) 1.3 m telescope in 1991
September. SQUID is equipped with four 256 x 256 platinum
silicide (PtSi) focal plane arrays. Dichroic mirrors were used to
allow simultaneous observations at four infrared wavelength
bands: J (1.2 um), H (1.6 wm), K (2.2 um), and L (3.4 um). For

cold, variable reddening to the background stars produced by
random, unrelated background and/or foreground dust clouds
presents a major limitation to the application of this method. A
reasonable application of this technique requires the dispersion
in background field star (H — K) colors to be smaller than the
observed range in (H — K) colors of the target stars. The disper-
sion in field star colors sets an additional lower limit to the
extinction that can be reliably measured. Observations of
control fields are necessary to establish the value of this limit.
Clearly, for the IC 5146 control fields, where the dispersion in
the (H — K) color is only 0.08 magnitudes, our lower extinction
limit is quite small, and this source of uncertainty 1s only
important for derived extinctions less than about 1 mag.
However, for many other molecular clouds, particularly in the
first quadrant of the Galaxy, this will be a severe and limiting
problem as can be ascertained from infrared observations of
M17 (Lada et al. 1991) and NGC 6334 (Straw & Hyland 1989).

3. Foreground/embedded stars—The color-excess method
assumes that all the stars observed are background stars. Fore-
ground stars or stars embedded in the cloud itself introduce
additional uncertainties in the determinations. In particular,
this method will not work for regions of molecular clouds
containing embedded clusters (such as The Trapezium, NGC
2024, NGC 2264, and M17, etc), where the surface density of
embedded stars exceeds that of background stars. However, for
IC 5146, the effects of embedded stars have been minimized by
the elimination of all stars with infrared excess from the
sample; moreover, the general agreement of the star count
maps with the molecular-line maps suggests that contami-
nation from embedded stars is minimal. On the other hand,
foreground star contamination may be a more significant
source of error. Such stars will act to decrease the derived
extinctions and will likely have a larger effect in regions of
highest extinction. This would lead to an increase in o with A,,
as is observed.

Our data can be used to make a reasonable estimate of the
level of foreground star contamination. In regions of high
extinction, the individual background stars should all be char-
acterized by relatively high extinctions. Foreground stars
should have colors indicative of zero extinction and should
easily stand out among stars of high extinctions. We have
examined the individual colors in all measurement boxes for
which the derived mean A, is greater than 9 mag. We searched
these data for all zero-magnitude extinction stars. We conser-
vatively defined a star to have zero extinction if its derived
extinction was less than or equal to 4 times the total photo-
metric uncertainty of the observations [i.e., Ay(*) < 40,,,,]. In
this manner we determined a firm upper limit to the mean
number of foreground stars in a typical measurement box to be
no greater than 0.32. This is small but not insignificant. The
effect of the presence of such stars On Op .,, and G4;,, can be
ascertained from modeling of the observations. We describe
such modeling in the following section (§ 5.2) of this paper.

4. Resolution and source structure-—Because our method
measures the mean extinction within a fixed area of the sky
(box), uncertainties can be introduced if the extinction is not
uniformly distributed across the measurement box. This can
happen if the cloud is significantly structured or clumpy on
scales smaller than the box size. Recent CO observations of IC
5146 obtained by Barnes Myers and Heyer (1994) at a
resolution of 55” show that there is structure on scales smaller
than our 1'5 measurement boxes. Clearly, then cloud structure
could have a significant effect on the o vs. Ay relation for the
Northern Streamer (eqs. [5] and [6]). However, the data can

Vol. 429

be modeled to assess the significance of cloud structure on the
observed errors and dispersions. In the next section of this
paper, we describe such modeling, which indicates that the
effects of small-scale cloud structure are primarily responsible
for the form of the o4;,,-Ay relation for this source.

The sources of error discussed above are largely statistical in
nature and pertain to the total uncertainty associated with the
determination of the mean color excess «E(H — K)>. The mean
color excess is proportional to extinction, which is in turn
proportional to dust column density and ultimately cloud
mass. To express our results in terms of either extinction,
column density, or mass, we need to know the corresponding
constants of proportionality. Any uncertainties in these con-
stants will introduce systematic uncertainties in the various
derived quantities which depend on them. We now consider
the major sources of systematic uncertainties in the various
derived quantities.

1. The reddening law.——Extinction is directly related to color
excess by the reddening or extinction law. We have chosen to
scale the mean color excess to an equivalent visual extinction,
Ay, using the standard extinction law. Our derived extinctions
correspond exactly to the true visual extinction only if the
extinction law for this cloud is normal. At visual and UV wave-
lengths the extinction law is known to vary along different lines
of sight in the galaxy (Mathis 1990 and references therein), and,
consequently, our derived visual extinctions will be systemati-
cally uncertain to the extent that the extinction law for this
cloud departs from the standard law at visual wavelengths.
However, in the near-infrared, the reddening law has been
found to be universal with little, if any, variation along differ-
ent lines of sight through the Galaxy (Mathis 1990 and refer-
ences therein). Consequently, E(H—K) can be scaled
confidently to an infrared extinction (e.g., Ax) using a standard
(normal) extinction law (e.g., Ax = 1.78 E(H—K) = 0.112 A,;
see Rieke & Lebofsky 1985), and the use of a standard extinc-
tion law does not introduce significant uncertainties in any of
the masses or column densities derived from the mean color
excess method.

2. Gas-to-dust ratio—The total hydrogen column density
for a map pixel is determined by scaling the extinction there by
the gas-to-dust ratio, R,_,. Similarly, determining the total
mass of the cloud also depends directly on this ratio. There is
considerable evidence to suggest that R,_, is constant or uni-
versal in the Galaxy at relatively low extinctions (i.e., Ay < 2
mag; see Lilley see 1955; Bohlin et al. 1978; Savage & Mathis
1979). It is not clear if the ratio will change at high extinctions
such as those characterizing the most opaque regions of IC
5146. Theoretical justification for a constant ratio at high
extinctions has been discussed by Dickman (1978) and will not
be considered here. In any event, our mass and hydrogen
column density determinations are systematically uncertain to
the extent that the gas-to-dust ratio in this source departs from
the universal value.

3. Distance-——By far the most uncertain quantity we derive
from our data is the mass of the cloud. This is because the
distance to the cloud is the largest source of systematic uncer-
tainty in the mass determinations. The uncertainty in the mass
of the cloud is given by

A, > 4 mag, the region of significant CS and C*8O emission
(here D is the distance to the cloud). We note here that
although the extinction map in Figure 6 accurately represents
the variation of dust column density in the cloud, it corre-
sponds to the true visual extinction through the cloud only to
the extent that the reddening law in this cloud is a normal one
(see following discussion). On the other hand, whether or not
this cloud has a normal reddening law has no effect on our
calculated hydrogen mass, since the gas-to-dust ratio we
employed is calibrated in regions of low extinction, where the
assumed normal reddening law applies.

5. INTERPRETATION AND DISCUSSION

5.1. Limitations and Uncertainties in the Method

When coupled with infrared array camera observations, the
method of deriving extinctions from color excesses (equations
[1]-[4]) becomes a very powerful and accurate technique for
measuring and mapping the distribution of dust and hydrogen
gas though a molecular cloud. However, the method is not
without limitations or uncertainties. The uncertainties associ-
ated with this method fall into two categories. First, there are
the uncertainties associated with the determination of color
excess, and these are largely statistical in nature. Second, there
are uncertainties introduced in the derivation of other physical
quantities such as extinction, gas column density, and cloud
mass from the color excess measurements. These latter uncer-
tainties are largely systematic in nature. We consider and
evaluate the two types of uncertainty separately as follows:

To determine the total (statistical) uncertainty o,,.,, 1n our
individual extinction measurements, we computed the disper-
sions (Gqisp) in the extinction and the resulting error in the
mean extinction (0,,¢an = Caisp//N ) for each pixel in the map.
These errors are actually errors in the color excess determi-
nations but are expressed in terms of extinction after being
scaled by the factor 15.9. In Figure 7 we plot o4;,, as a function
of mean A,. (The variation of ¢,,.a, With A, is virtually indis-
tinguishable from that of o4;,, with Ay, apart from a /N
reduction in scale.) We find the very interesting result that o4;,,
(and ¢,,-a,) increase in a systematic fashion with increasing Ay.

DARK CLOUD IC 5146 701

Both trends are well fitted by linear relations:
Oaisp = (0.73 + 0.09) + (0.40 + 0.01)A, , (5)
Omean = (0.22 + 0.05) + (0.22 + 0.01)A, . (6)

Moreover, the dispersion in both relations (1.e., the dispersions
in the quantities o4;,, and 0,,.,, themselves) also increases with
Ay. In fact, the dispersion in o4;,, is a factor of 2.4 larger for
Ay > 10 mag than for A, < 10 mag.

There are several sources of uncertainty which are
responsible for producing the form of the observed o4;,,-Ay
and 6,,ean~Ay relations. These include the following.

1. Photometry—The fundamental source of statistical
uncertainty is the photometric uncertainty in the infrared
observations. These errors effectively set the lower limit to the
amount of extinction which can be significantly measured. The
measurement uncertainty for a given box or map pixel due to
random photometric errors_in the individual measurements is
given by: 9 phot = (15.9/N),/Z1[o(H — K)? + o(H — K)intrinsic] ~
15.90,/./N visual magnitudes, where o(H—K) is_ the
photometric error in the derived colors, o, = [o(H—K)*
+ o(H—K)} winsicl’/* is the corresponding error in the color
excess and N is the number of stars in the box. For values
typical of the IC 5146 observations (i.e., 5% photometry, a
0.5% uncertainty in the intrinsic color excess, and N equal to
the mean number [5] of stars in a box), we estimate a total
photometric uncertainty of 0.5 mag in the mean A, for a
typical box. Consequently, our extinction measurements have
a very high degree of confidence for Ay > 1.5 mag. Since the
data were filtered to include only observations of high photo-
metric quality, o,,., is not a strong function of A). These con-
siderations indicate that for extinctions greater than about 5
mag, the total uncertainty is dominated by effects other than
photometric errors.

2. Background star colors——Because application of the
color-excess method results in a determination of the line-of-
sight extinction between the observer and the stars behind the

scale corresponding to the original color excess observations is also drawn.
The dispersion in the measurements and g,,,.,,, the total uncertainty in the
derived mean extinctions (and color excesses), are related as O,,.an = Saisp// N,
where N is the number of stars used to derive the mean A, for a given
measurement box.

measurement box (in square radians), and the factor 0.25 is a
correction for oversampling. For the regions with A, > 4.0
mag, we find the fractional statistical uncertainty,
o[X(Ay)]/Z(Ay), to be only 1%. The distance to the Northern
Streamer is usually assumed to be the same as that (900 pc)
derived optically for the cluster IC 5146 (e.g., Elias 1978;
Dobashi et al. 1992). Although the cluster is at a relatively large
projected distance from the Northern Streamer, this assump-
tion seems justified by the presence of a bridge of 17CO and
‘3CO emission which appears to connect the cluster and the
streamers (Fig. 1; see also Dobashi et al. 1992). However, the
relative lack of foreground stars toward the dark clouds which
make up the Northern Streamer suggests a distance closer than
900 pc. Indeed, if the predictions of the Bahcall & Soneria
(1980) model of the Galaxy are scaled to our control field
observations, we find that we expect to observe an average of
2.1 foreground stars in a typical 15 measurement box in this
direction of the Galaxy for a 1 kpc distance to the cloud. To
reduce this to a number close to that actually estimated from
our observations (see above) requires the cloud to be at a
distance of about 400 pc. Consequently, we consider the dis-
tance to the Northern Streamer to be highly uncertain and
probably smaller than the 900 pc usually quoted in the liter-
ature.

5.2. Modeling and Cloud Structure

It is possible to predict the form of the o4;,,-Ay relation by
modeling the structure of the cloud and the foreground star
distribution. In the case where the foreground star contribu-
tion is small or known, the o4;,,-Ay relation can be used to
derive direct and quantitative information about the nature of
the spatial distribution of dust on scales smaller than our effec-
tive binning box resolution.

We constructed Monte Carlo models to mimic the infrared
observations and predict o4;,,-Ay curves for various cloud con-
figurations. We first assumed that the spatial distribution of
dust had the same functional form in all 1000 measurement
boxes. However, the model boxes differed from one another in
the total amount or mean extinction contained within them.
This mean extinction was varied from 0-25 mag. Between
these two limits of mean extinction, the boxes were divided
equally into bins 0.2 mag wide. To obtain a measurement of
mean extinction which corresponded to that derived from
observations, model stars were randomly generated and placed
within each counting box. The extinction to each star was
calculated from the input dust distribution assuming that the
stars were background objects. Noise, simulating photometric
measurement errors was also added to each star’s extinction
value. The mean extinction and its dispersion were calculated
for all the stars in each box. To determine the number of stars
to be placed in each box we assumed a Poisson distribution
with a mean of 5, similar to the observed value. For each
extinction step, typically seven boxes of stars were created and
measured. The results were then plotted in the form of a o4;,,-
A, relation similar to the observations.

Figure 8 shows the o4;,,-Ay relation for the case of a uniform
distribution of extinction in each box and no foreground stars.
The predicted dispersions are constant and independent of Ay
with an internal scatter also independent of A, and consistent
with that expected solely from the photometric errors intro-
duced in the model. This is clearly different from the observa-
tions of IC 5146. It is possible that the presence of foreground
stars in the measurement boxes could account for some of the

effects which characterize the observed o4;,,-Ay relation. To
investigate this possibility, foreground stars were added to the
model by assuming that they had zero mean extinction plus
some measurement noise and that their probability of being
found in a measurement box was given by a Poisson distribu-
tion function with a mean of 0.32, corresponding to observa-
tions. The resulting o4;,,-Ay relation is shown in Figure 9. The
inclusion of foreground stars alters the relation between disper-
sion and extinction, but again the relation has little resem-
blance to the actual observations. These results rule out
models for cloud structure which assume a uniform spatial
distribution of dust on scales smaller than a box size (i.e., <
1'5). These results also indicate that cloud structure is likely
more important for determining the form of the observed o4;,,-
A, relation than is forground star contamination.

Since uniform extinction models can not account for the
observations, we investigated other classes of models which
describe different spatial distributions of dust. Figure 10 shows
the resulting o4;,,.-Ay relation for models which assume that
the dust is distributed in discrete, high extinction clumps

of foreground stars cannot explain the observed data and that the observed
form of the o-A, relation must be largely a result of small-scale variations in
cloud structure and not due to the presence of foreground stars.

tions where common data were obtained.

In order to quantify the various correlations, we performed
linear least-square fits over varying ranges of A, for all three
molecular lines. We found that the 1*CO emission could be
fitted by a linear relation with a constant slope from zero up to
5—6 mag of extinction. For maximum extinction values larger
than about 8 mag, the values of the derived slope significantly
decreased, and the quality of the fit decline considerably. We
conclude that the '*CO integrated intensity is roughly linearly
correlated with A, between 0 and about 5 mag. When extinc-
tions reach between 8 and 10 mag, the !*CO emission appears
saturated. Both C'8O and CS emission could be reasonably
fitted by linear relations with A, over the entire range of
observed extinctions. In both cases, the slopes of the fitted
relations are constant for fits spanning ranges of A, from 0 up
to 15 mag. However, the slopes of the fits performed over
increasingly larger ranges of extinction are found to decrease.
This decrease in slope could be caused by opacity effects which
begin to set in for these molecules at about 15 mag of visual
extinction or a decrease in their relative abundances at large
extinctions. In addition, the relatively large uncertainties in A,
at large extinctions could also contribute to a change in slope

We observe large scatter in all three relations. Such large
scatter also characterizes similar relations derived from star
count studies (e.g., Dickman 1978; Bachiller & Cernicharo
1986; Langer et al. 1989, etc.). The scatter in these relations has
two possible origins: it can be intrinsic and/or the result of
experimental (instrumental) uncertainties. Instrumental uncer-
tainties give rise to scatter in the determinations of both inte-
grated intensity and extinction. The instrumental uncertainty,
d;;, in the integrated intensity for each molecular-line spectrum
was determined by integrating over a 4 km s~' wide region of
the spectrum well outside the velocity limits of observed molec-
ular emission. The instrumental uncertainty in the extinction,
Fphot. Was determined in the manner described earlier in this
paper. As discussed earlier, there are additional uncertainties in
the extinction measurements due in most part to variations in
cloud structure on small angular scales. These uncertainties
become important for A, > 5 mag.

The size of the typical instrumental uncertainties in inte-
grated intensities and extinction are plotted in Figures 13-15.
In all three cases, the scatter appears larger than allowed by the
instrumental errors. Moreover, the scatter in the 1*CO versus
Ay plot (Fig. 13) appears to be considerably larger than that
exhibited in the corresponding C'®O and CS plots (Figs. 14
and 15). Indeed, we find that the dispersion of the residuals,

than the corresponding <o;;>, the mean uncertainty in inte-
grated intensity, by factors of 4.8, 1.6, and 2.2 for '°CO, C180,
and CS observations, respectively. This suggests that the origin
of the large scatter in the ‘CO versus A, relation is intrinsic
and not the result of any additional uncertainties in extinction
measurements introduced by variations in cloud structure. The
origin of such intrinsic scatter is astrophysical in nature and
likely due to intrinsic variations in the excitation or abundance

models, the mean extinction in a box is directly related to the
filling factor of the clumps, which is varied from zero to unity
in order to span the range of observed extinctions. As in the

a= 0.85 + 0.05, and 6,4. =0.5+0.2. The model data for
a = 0.85, and o,,. = 0.5 are shown in Fig. 11 where we have
also included the contribution of foreground stars. The general
agreement with the data is remarkable, although we do find
that the fits are not as nearly well constrained if the contribu-
tion due to foreground star contamination is allowed to vary in
any significant way. The physical significance of this particular
set of cloud models and their agreement with observations is
not clear from the present analysis. Nonetheless, it seems clear
that simple models of uniform dust distribution and clumpi-
ness are ruled out by our observations. Moreover, foreground
star contamination alone cannot account for the observed rela-
tions present in the data.

Finally, we note that cloud structure variations are also a
significant source of uncertainty for interpreting star count
data or molecular line observations made with single aperture
telescopes, whose resolution is large compared to interesting
physical structure. However, unlike these techniques, which are
inherently incapable of sensing such difficulties, the color
excess method for deriving extinctions presented here provides
a quantitative assessment of the magnitude of such uncer-
tainties and in the process an additional probe of the cloud
structure itself. This is a major advantage of this method of
measurement. Our results also suggest that foreground star
contamination can be a serious problem in some instances.
Such contamination can also present major limitations for star
count measurements as can be ascertained from the star count
maps of the Orion Cloud (Rosanno 1980). However, the fore-
ground contribution to star counts cannot be determined from
star count data alone.

5.3. Comparison of the Molecular-Line and Extinction Data

Figure 12 shows our map of integrated C'8O emission
(between 2 and 6 km s~*) of the Northern Streamer drawn on
the same scale as the extinction map (Fig. 6). The general
appearence of the two maps is remarkably similar. This is not
entirely unexpected, since both maps trace column density.
Comparison of the two maps provides direct information on
the dust-to-(CO) gas ratio and its constancy through the
cloud. In order to facilitate a more detailed comparison of the
extinction and molecular-line data, we constructed an addi-
tional extinction map of the cloud with the same angular
resolution (1'7) and grid spacing (1’) as the molecular line
maps. In Figures 13, 14, and 15 we show the relation between
visual extinction and the integrated intensities (between 2 and

contour is 1.5K kms’. Subsequent contours increase in steps of 1.5 K km s~!. The reference (0,0) position of the map is &1959 = 2151548; 5,959 = +47°01'12”.
The cluster IC 5146 is located at the (0,0) position of this map. The Northern Streamer is the region of bright emission centered approximately at map coordinates
(— 80, 20). (b) The integrated intensity map of CS emission in the IC 5146 region. The lowest contour plotted here is at 0.2 K km s~!. Subsequent contours increase in
equal steps of 0.2 K kms” *. Subsequent contours increase in equal steps of 0.2 K km s~!. Otherwise the same as (a).

3.2. Infrared Imaging Observations
3.2.1. Stellar Spatial Distribution

Figure 2 shows the positions of all the 3760 J-band stars
with J < 16 mag that we extracted from the infrared images of
the Northern Streamer region of the IC 5146 dark cloud
complex. The surface density of J-band stars is relatively high
but clearly not uniform across this region of the dark cloud. To
obtain a more quantitative estimate of the distribution of
stellar surface density, we constructed a star count map of the
region from the observations shown in Figure 2. The star
counts were obtained by subdividing the region into a rectilin-
ear grid of overlapping squares, each 1’5 x 1/5 in size, and then
counting the total number of stars in each square. The centers
of each such reseau square were separated by 0:75, the Nyquist
spatial sampling interval. The number of stars counted in each
